Beer punishment

In the halls of beer, where pints do flow, <br />
And laughter rings, like a drunken show, <br />
There lies a rule, that all should know, <br />
For beer fines, they will come and go. <br />

When glasses break, or spills do occur, <br />
Or someone speaks, with slurred slurs, <br />
The beer fine bell, will loudly whir, <br />
And payment must be made, with a cheer or purr. <br />

But though the fines may sting the pride, <br />
They are a part, of the beer-filled ride, <br />
For with each fine, a story is tied, <br />
And memories made, that never subside.
